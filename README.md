# slowExtractionMADX

These are the most recent MADX files for SPS slow extraction simulations.

2 'versions' of the code are present:
 - "Francesco's version" using general_se.madx. Not all original files are present anymore, and we should check and repair where necessary.
 - "Linda's" version using setup files in the cmd folder to run for example spiral_step_table.madx or thin_tracking_example.madx
